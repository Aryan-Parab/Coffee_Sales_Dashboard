# Coffee_Sales_Dashboard
ðŸ“Š Excited to share insights from a comprehensive analysis of our Coffee Shop dataset, comprising three key sheets: Orders, Product, and Customers. Leveraging advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, and XLOOKUP, we seamlessly integrated data for a holistic view.

ðŸ”„ The Orders sheet serves as the central hub, marrying information from Product and Customers sheets. 

ðŸ“ˆ Utilizing Pivot Tables, we extracted meaningful patterns, trends, and customer behaviors, setting the stage for informed decision-making.

ðŸš€ The dynamic dashboard showcases a synchronized trio of Line Charts, Slicers, and Bar Charts, offering a visually compelling representation of key metrics. This interactive approach enhances accessibility and facilitates a deeper understanding of the data.
